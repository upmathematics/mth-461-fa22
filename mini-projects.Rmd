<br>

This semester, we will focus on two distinct topics. The case studies below are guided projects meaning instructions, problem sets, and open-ended questions are provided.

<br>

## **Learning Objectives**

There are three main objectives for the mini-projects, which is in line with the learning objectives of MTH 461 course:

1. To learn skills in data acumen, wrangling, and visualization.
2. To learn effective and concise communication of data.
3. To learn new and existing methods and to hone independent learning.

Each mini-project will be evaluated according to the above objectives and the learning outcomes outlined in the Syllabus.

<br>

## **Case Studies**

*Note: The case studies are tentative and may change throughout the course.*

### Case Study: Linguistic Patterns in Text Data Sets

#### Overview

Text data is one of the most over abundant data that exist. Not all of them are useful but some can be very valuable. Extracting insights from text data can be very tedious and challenging. This mini-project case-study will guide you on the basics of the analysis of text data.

#### Datasets

This project focuses on these independent data sets.

1. **Sentence Polarity Dataset v1.0**

    *Source:* [Cornell - Sentence Polarity Movie Reviews](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/){target="_blank"}

2. **AG's News Topic Classification Dataset**

    *Source:* [Kaggle - News Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset){target="_blank"}.
    
    *R Access:* The `dataset_ag_news` data in the `textdata` package.

3. **NRC Emotion Lexicon**

    *Source:* [NRC Emotion Lexicon](https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm){target="_blank"}

    *R Access:* The `lexicon_nrc`, `lexicon_nrc_vad`, and `lexicon_nrc_eil` data in the `textdata` package.

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this mini-project, the students should be able to do the following:

* Understand and process text data.

* Apply the concepts of Discrete random variables and probability mass functions using the datasets.

* Able to provide statistical analysis and conclusions, and relate them into probability and statistical concepts learned in class.

* Able to use R for data processing, visualization, and story-telling.

#### Learning Outcomes

There two expected outcomes of this mini-project:

1. A final report in PDF-knitted Rmd.

More details to follow.
