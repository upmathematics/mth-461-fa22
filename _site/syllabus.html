<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Probability and Statistics is fundamental in many scientific
disciplines. In this course, a student will learn the concepts in
probability, discrete and continuous random variables, expectation,
important probability distributions, sampling, and estimation. This is a
calculus-based probability and statistics course where we use analytical
solutions to problems, as well as simulation-based reasoning using R.
Students who complete this course will have a calculus-based knowledge
of probability theory and statistics and be able to confidently apply
these ideas to data.</p>

<h2><strong>Academic Support</strong></h2>
<p><br></p>
<div id="collaboration-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>We expect you to participate in the class through lectures,
discussion, labs, and other engagements. We also expect you to make use
of opportunities to get help outside of class (office hours, Teams,
email, tutoring) if you need help. Concise and specific messages are the
most helpful.</p>
<p>It is encouraged that students participate in discussions regarding
mini-assignments, modules, and mini-projects. However, each student must
take responsibility and ownership of their work and submit their work
individually.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="office-hours-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Office Hours Guidelines</h3>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you attend the walk-in office hours
or set up a one-to-one office hours with the instructor if you feel like
you are falling behind during our in-person class activities, or if you
just need to clarify concepts discussed in class. In order to be more
productive during a one-to-one office hours (or the walk-in office
hours), these are three recommendations before you come-in:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all gaps in knowledge you have (missed concepts) or list all
concepts that was unclear to you during class. We will address them one
by one.</li>
<li>Prepare questions you want answered and be ready to show relevant
materials.</li>
<li>Regarding assignments, prepare to show (a) what are the steps you
have tried and (b) what are the errors you encountered and the solutions
you have tried.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are recommendations so that you can get the most out
of the Office hours allocated for you. If you just want to come-in and
chat about something else, feel free to do so. If the dedicated time for
one-to-one office hours does not work for you, send the instructor a
message to set up an appointment.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="the-learning-commons" class="section level3">
<h3>The Learning Commons</h3>
<p>Students can get academic assistance through Learning Commons
tutoring services and workshops. The Co-Pilot peer tutoring program
provides students with opportunities to work with other students to get
help in writing, math, group projects, and other courses. Schedule an
appointment to meet with a Co-Pilot (tutor) by visiting the Learning
Commons website <a href="www.up.edu/learningcommons"
target="_blank">www.up.edu/learningcommons</a>. Students can also meet
with a Co-Pilot during drop-in hours. Check the Learning Commons website
or drop by the Learning Commons in BC 163 Monday – Friday from 9:00 a.m.
– 5:00 p.m. to learn more about their services. Find a tutor at the
Learning Commons to get support on your academic journey.</p>

<div id="accessibility-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Accessibility Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland endeavors to make its courses and services
fully accessible to all students. Students are encouraged to discuss
with their instructors what might be most helpful in enabling them to
meet the learning goals of the course. Students who experience a
disability are also encouraged to use the services of the Office for
Accessible Education Services (AES), located in the Shepard Academic
Resource Center (503-943-8985). If you have an AES Accommodation Plan,
you should make an appointment to meet with your faculty member to
discuss how to implement your plan in this class. Requests for alternate
location for exams and/or extended exam time should, where possible, be
made two weeks in advance of an exam, and must be made at least one week
in advance of an exam. Also, if applicable, you should meet with your
faculty member to discuss emergency medical information or how best to
ensure your safe evacuation from the building in case of fire or other
emergency.</p>

<h3>Late Assignments and Incompletes</h3>
<p>You are expected to turn in all completed assignments on time.
Circumstances that may disallow you to turn in your work on time – such
as a medical reason – are understandable. Please let the instructor know
if you are unable to submit your work and have missed the deadline way
beyond its original posted date. Because every assignment is an
important aspect of your learning in this class, we will discuss when
you will turn in the assignment as well as decide upon an acceptable
consequence for your turning it in late. We are committed to
successfully helping you learn from this course.</p>

<h3>Non-Violence Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is committed to fostering a community free
from all forms of violence in which all members feel safe and respected.
Violence of any kind, and in particular acts of power-based personal
violence, are inconsistent with our mission. Together, we take a stand
against violence. Join us in learning more about campus and community
resources, UP’s prevention strategy, and reporting options on the Green
Dot website, <a href="www.up.edu/greendot"

<div id="academic-honor-principle" class="section level3">
<h3>Academic Honor Principle</h3>
<p>Academic integrity is openness and honesty in all scholarly
endeavors. The University of Portland is a scholarly community dedicated
to the discovery, investigation, and dissemination of truth, and to the
development of the whole person. Membership in this community is a
privilege, requiring each person to practice academic integrity at its
highest level, while expecting and promoting the same in others.
Breaches of academic integrity will not be tolerated and will be
addressed by the community with all due gravity.</p>
<p>In your written work, follow the conventions of an appropriate
citation using the APA, MLA, CSE, or SIAM styles. Please consult with
the instructor - or <a

Guides</a> if you have questions about proper citations.</p>

<div id="inclusion-and-diversity" class="section level3">
<h3>Inclusion and Diversity</h3>
<p>The natural and mathematical sciences are often viewed as objective
disciplines. Science is a method for us to understand how the world
works. However, it is historically built from a small set of privileged
populations that often ignores the biases. We acknowledge that there may
be some parts in this course that have overt and covert biases. Science
is a human endeavor, and the pursuit of knowledge and skill must
incorporate a diverse set of experiences.</p>
<p>We value all students regardless of their background, country of
origin, race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability
status, etc. We are committed to providing a climate of excellence and
inclusiveness within all aspects of this course. If you have any
concerns, issues, or challenges, you are encouraged to discuss with the
instructor (set up a meeting by email or a direct message in Teams) with
the assurance of full confidentiality except for academic integrity code
violations or sexual harassment.</p>

<div id="mental-health-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Mental Health Statement</h3>
<p>As a college student, you may sometimes experience problems with your
mental health that interfere with academic experiences and negatively
impact daily life. If you or someone you know experiences mental health
challenges at UP, please contact the University of Portland Health and
Counseling Center in Orrico Hall (down the hill from Franz Hall and near
Mehling Hall) at 503-943-7134 or <a href="mailto:hcc@up.edu"
class="email">hcc@up.edu</a>. Their services are free and confidential,
and if necessary they can provide same day appointments. In addition,
phone counseling is available by calling 503-943-7134 and pressing 3.
The University of Portland Campus Safety Department (503-943-4444) also
has personnel trained to respond sensitively to mental health
emergencies at all hours. Remember that getting help is a smart and
courageous thing to do – for yourself, for those you care about, and for
those who care about you.</p>

<div id="covid-19-related-statements" class="section level3">
<h3>COVID-19 Related Statements</h3>
<p>Generally, students are expected to attend all class sessions
according to the instructor’s direction. Students who feel unwell or
have a temperature above 100 degrees should NOT attend class in person.
These students should inform their instructor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Students who must be in isolation due to COVID-19 symptoms or a
positive test should also contact their instructor as soon as possible
to work out details for keeping up with the course material while in
isolation.</p>
<p>Should the instructor test positive for COVID-19, even without
symptoms, the course will be temporarily conducted remotely. Should the
instructor be unable to teach for an extended period of time, the
respective department or unit will find a substitute to continue the
course.</p>
<p>Following current guidance from our county and state health
authorities, face coverings are highly recommended in the classroom and
all indoor spaces. As we move through the semester, however, classroom
rules and procedures may change. All students and instructors must
follow any University-wide COVID-19 rules and procedures that might be
in put place at any given time during the semester for classrooms, labs,
and all common areas of academic buildings. Such rules and procedures
may include required face coverings, suggested distancing protocols and
directions, and limitations on eating and drinking in the classroom,
among other things. Failure to follow any of the COVID-19 classroom
rules in place at the time could result in a student’s removal from the
course and/or a report filed with the Office of Student Conduct.</p>

<div id="ethics-of-information" class="section level3">
<h3>Ethics of Information</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a community dedicated to the
investigation and discovery of processes for thinking ethically and
encouraging the development of ethical reasoning in the formation of the
whole person. Using information ethically, as an element in open and
honest scholarly endeavors, involves moral reasoning to determine the
right way to access, create, distribute, and employ information
including: considerations of intellectual property rights, fair use,
information bias, censorship, and privacy. More information can be found
in the Clark Library’s guide to the Ethical Use of Information at <a
