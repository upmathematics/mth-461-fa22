## Probability Terminologies

**[PSDR] Definition 2.1.**

Terminology for statistical experiments:

- An **experiment** is a process that produces an observation.
- An **outcome** is a possible observation.
- The set of all possible outcomes is called the **sample space**.
- An **event** is a subset of the sample space.
- A **trial** is a single running of an experiment.

## Set Theory Basics

**[PSDR] Definition 2.5**

Let $A$ and $B$ be events in a sample space $S$.

1. $A \cap B$ is the set of outcomes that are in both $A$ and $B$.
2. $A \cup B$ is the set of outcomes that are in either $A$ or $B$ (or both).
3. $A âˆ’ B$  is the set of outcomes that are in $A$ and not in $B$.
4. The complement of $A$ is $\bar{A} = S - A$. So, $\overline{A}$ is the set of all outcomes that are not in $A$.
5. The symbol $\emptyset$ is the empty set, the set with no outcomes.
6. $A$ and $B$ are disjoint if $A \cap B = \emptyset$.
7. $A$ is a subset of $B$, written $A \subset B$, if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.

## Probability Axioms Part 1

**[PSDR] Definition 2.7**

Let $S$ be a sample space. A valid probability satisfies the following *probability axioms*:

1. Probabilities are non-negative real numbers. That is, for all events $E$, $P(E) > 0$.
2. The probability of the sample space is $1$, $P(S) = 1$.
3. Probabilities are countably additive: If $A_1, A_2, \cdots$ are pairwise disjoint, then
$$P\left( \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \right) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n)$$

## Probability Axioms Part 2

**[PSDR] Theorem 2.1**

Let $A$ and $B$ be events in the sample space $S$.

1. $P(\emptyset) = 0$.
2. If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B).
3. If $A \subset B$, then $P(A) \le P(B)$.
4. $0 \le P(A) \le 1$
5. $P(A) = 1 - P(\overline{A})$
6. $P(A - B) = P(A) - P(A \cap B)$
7. $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$

## Independence

**[PSDR] Definition 2.20**

Two events are said to be *independent* if knowledge that one event occurs does not give any probabilistic information as to whether the other event occurs. Formally, we say that $A$ and $B$ are independent if $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$.

Events $A$ and $B$ are said to be dependent if they are not independent.
