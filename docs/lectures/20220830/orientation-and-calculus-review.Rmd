## Why Probability? {.smaller}

<div class='left' style='float:left;text-align:left;width:49%'>
- **Applied Mathematics**
  * Does a probabilistic sequence converge or diverge?
  
- **Bioengineering**
  * What percentage of lyme disease patients would be cured with the current but experimental treatments?
  
- **Chemical Sciences**
  * What proportion of reactants undergo a reaction early in the reaction?
</div>

<div class='right' style='float:left;text-align:left;width:49%'>
- **Computer Science**
  * How many computers in a given network would be affected after a virus infection?
  
- **Mechanical Engineering**
  * What is the probability that two engines of a commercial airplane fail during flight? 
  
- **Environmental Science**
  * What is the concentration of carbon monoxide in the ambient atmosphere in 20 years?
</div>

## Why Statistics? {.smaller}

* Statistics is the science of learning from data.
* Statistical knowledge is important in scientific studies:
  - plan the studies to ensure that the data are collected efficiently and answer questions relevant to the investigation 
  - analyze data, discover what conclusions can be reached from current study and what issues need to be investigated further
* Various applications:
  - weather forecasting
  - drug/vaccination development (effectiveness and safety)
  - automated question anwering
  - text classification
  - language translation

## Course Description

<center>
<div class='left' style='text-align:left;width:80%'>
* This is a calculus-based probability and statistics course. 
* Students will learn the concepts in probability, discrete and continuous random variables, expectation, important probability distributions, sampling, and estimation. 
* Simulation-based reasoning using R will help students understand how to apply these ideas to data.

## Course Materials

* We will be using Teams [mth-461a-fa22](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aZWmNLgAQL0Vt__PZ2qLdmGNPJB0r6ChJXXVf2lzsT-E1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=e41b3e0c-9f5c-4496-a6a4-e51b0941d10e&tenantId=ea8f3949-231c-40b6-a33f-56873af96f87){target="_blank"} as the main real-time communication tool.
* The syllabus, tentative topics schedule, lecture slides, assignments, mini-project information, and all other class materials are posted on the [course website](https://upmathematics.github.io/mth-461a-fa22/index.html) - the website can be viewed in Teams.
* The main textbook is [Probability, Statistics, and Data: A fresh approach using R](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/){target="_blank"} by Darrin Speegle and Bryan Clair. The textbook is free and open-source.
* This class will use the R programming language and the R Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Mini-Assignments & Modules

* *Mini-Assignments:* These are written assignments due each class time at end-of-class or end-of-day (27 mini-assignments in total).
* *Modules:* These are both written and R assignments due every three weeks (5 Modules in total).
* *Mini-Projects:* There are 2 mini-projects where we apply concepts and tools learned in class to understand real world data sets. These projects involve text data sets and spatio-temporal data sets.

<center>
*All assignments and mini-project reports are submitted through Teams Assignments.*
